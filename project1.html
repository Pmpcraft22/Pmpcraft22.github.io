<h1> Jack Stauber </h1>
<p>Jack Stauber is a very interesting man who creates many music and animated shorts on various platforms. He is my favorite artist and is single handedly the most unique artist and person I've ever seen. His music and sounds he makes are amazing and the coolest thing is that he has two different titles. Jack Stauber is his music that seems normal to the average person and then he has Jack Stauber's Micropop. </p>

<h2> Jack Stauber's Micropop </h2>
<p> Jack Stauber's Micropop is his secondary form of music which takes an entire new approach towards making sounds from his main title. The best way to describe how it sounds is to say he sings in <i> Cursive </i> which sounds amazing.</p>

<p> The iceberg for Jack lore dives as deep as you can imagine, the man is a living mystery from often looking dead when he performs to making many many questionable videos that have, at first glance, no meaning. Although him not being very popular, <b> Adult Swim </b> has paid him to create two specials for them. The links for such will be below.</p>
